# Parkinson’s Disease Classification using Machine Learning
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify individuals as healthy or Parkinson’s patients based on biomedical voice measurements. Using data sourced from Kaggle, I built a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing and feature scaling to model training and evaluation, achieving high accuracy in predicting Parkinson’s disease.

# Executive Summary – Parkinson’s Disease Classification using SVM

## Objective
1.	The primary goal of this project was to classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease (PD) or not, using biomedical voice measurement data.
2.	The dataset consists of voice recordings from 31 individuals (23 with PD, 8 healthy), with 195 total instances.

## Dataset Information
	1. Each row represents one voice recording.
	2. The status column is the target variable:
	    0 → Healthy
	    1 → Parkinson’s Disease
	3. Features include fundamental frequency measures, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonic ratios, and nonlinear measures (e.g., RPDE, DFA, spread1, PPE).
