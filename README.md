# Parkinson’s Disease Classification using Machine Learning
This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify individuals as healthy or Parkinson’s patients based on biomedical voice measurements. Using data sourced from Kaggle, I built a complete machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing and feature scaling to model training and evaluation, achieving high accuracy in predicting Parkinson’s disease.

# Executive Summary – Parkinson’s Disease Classification using SVM

# Objective
2.	The primary goal of this project was to classify whether a person has Parkinson’s disease (PD) or not, using biomedical voice measurement data.
